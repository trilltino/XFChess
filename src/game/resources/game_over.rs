//! Game over state tracking and result management
//!
//! Tracks end-game conditions (checkmate, stalemate, timeout, resignation) and
//! provides methods for determining game outcome and displaying results.
//!
//! # Game Over Conditions
//!
//! ## Checkmate
//! - **WhiteWon**: Black is in check with no legal moves
//! - **BlackWon**: White is in check with no legal moves
//!
//! ## Draw Conditions
//! - **Stalemate**: Current player has no legal moves but is NOT in check
//! - **InsufficientMaterial**: Neither player can deliver checkmate (e.g., K vs K)
//!
//! ## Time Control
//! - **WhiteWonByTime**: Black's time expired
//! - **BlackWonByTime**: White's time expired
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! This resource is checked by:

/// Resource tracking the game's end state
///
/// Starts as `Playing` and transitions to a terminal state when the game ends.
/// Once set to any non-Playing state, the game should disable move input and
/// display the result to players.

/// # State Transitions
///
/// ```text
/// Playing â†’ WhiteWon / BlackWon / Stalemate / InsufficientMaterial / WhiteWonByTime / BlackWonByTime
/// ```
///
/// All non-Playing states are terminal (game cannot continue).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Detecting checkmate
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// fn check_for_checkmate(
///     mut game_over: ResMut<GameOverState>,
///     current_turn: Res<CurrentTurn>,
///     // ... other parameters for move validation

///             PieceColor::Black => GameOverState::WhiteWon, // White checkmated Black
///         };
///     }
/// }

/// ## Displaying result
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// fn display_game_result(game_over: Res<GameOverState>) {
///     if game_over.is_game_over() {
///         println!("{}", game_over.message());
